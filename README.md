# RL_lspi_svd
RL SVD feature policy iteration

For 50 iterations or until A_next is identical to A
1)Sample according to policy
K=number of fetures
weights=np.zeros(n_actions,K)
For each action:
  2) Crate matrix A, A_next for each action
   
  4) Calculte low rank approximation

  6) Calculate by Woodbery Identity invers e for calculation of weights

weught_actions=np.stac
8) Update for agent our weight 
9) agent.weughts(weight)
10) Sample according to agent policy
11)
